## NOTES
### What is typescript
Typescript is statically typed language which is a superset of Javascript. It has the following 
### Advantages:
- Type safety
- Easy to detect errors early because of type safety
- Helps in code completion in IDEs because a particular type is associated to it
- Has shorthand notations like arrow functions, optional chaining and nullish coalescing. ( This is also present in Javascript too)

### Disadvantages:
- You have to do transpliation i.e converting from typescript to javascript
- Not understood by browsers


### Datatypes
#### Basic datatypes:
- number
- string
- boolean
- null
- undefined
- object


#### Advanced datatypes:
- type aliases
- unions (|) and intersections (&)
- type narrowing ( kind of checking either this or that datatype ( which uses the union operator))
- enums
