// tuples is a fixed length array with particular types

// can't add more than 2 elements here
// tuples are usually good if you have key value pairs or it may get too confusing (too many parameters)
let user: [number, string] = [1, 'Rachana'];

// any user but this is bad practice
let anyUser: [any, any] = ['Something', 'Anything'];
